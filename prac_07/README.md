## Lessons on Clean Code

Throughout this course, I've learned many invaluable lessons about writing clean, maintainable code. Some of the main takeaways include:

- **Readability is Key**: A piece of code should be as easy to read as plain English. Avoid cryptic variable names and always opt for clarity.
- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself. Repeated code should be refactored into functions or methods to make the codebase easier to manage and reduce potential errors.
- **Comments and Documentation**: While code should be self-explanatory, comments can provide crucial context. However, avoid unnecessary comments that state the obvious.
